the formula for translating arduino reported position data (which is given in encoder counts):
	- position / encoderCountPerInch + this.axisLength;
	(invert the position value, divide by encoder counts per inch and add the length of the axis)
	
x axis calibration uses the following formula for the target to calibrate to:
	25% of (axis length (24") - 0.1") + 0.1"
	no idea why the strange offsets are needed.
